# Double Dribble Native C Port

Source-only native C port of **Double Dribble (USA) (Rev 1)** for NES. The runtime does not emulate a 6502/PPU/APU and never opens the ROM. A validated importer converts the user-owned ROM into an ignored, versioned asset pack.

## Current milestone

The native Win32 program renders the title screen and plays the spoken "Double Dribble" DMC cue. The visible native title matches the local FCEUX frame-30 reference exactly.

## Build

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -RomPath 'F:\Games\NES\Double Dribble\Double Dribble (USA) (Rev 1).nes'
```

Every build requires the supported ROM and produces `build\double-dribble.assetpack`. No ROM-derived outputs are tracked by Git.

Run the native title milestone:

```powershell
.\build\double_dribble_game.exe .\build\double-dribble.assetpack
```

Reproduce the reference and native captures:

```powershell
.\tools\fceux\Capture-OriginalTitle.ps1 -FinalFrame 30
.\tools\Capture-NativeTitle.ps1
.\tools\Compare-TitleCaptures.ps1
```
