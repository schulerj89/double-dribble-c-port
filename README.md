# Double Dribble Native C Port

Source-only native C port of **Double Dribble (USA) (Rev 1)** for NES. The runtime does not emulate a 6502/PPU/APU and never opens the ROM. A validated importer converts the user-owned ROM into an ignored, versioned asset pack.

## Current milestone

The native Win32 program renders the title screen, plays the spoken "Double Dribble" cue, accepts keyboard selection, and starts the 1P city/road intro with music. The title and stable road-intro checkpoints match local FCEUX references exactly.

## Build

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -RomPath 'F:\Games\NES\Double Dribble\Double Dribble (USA) (Rev 1).nes'
```

Every build requires the supported ROM and produces `build\double-dribble.assetpack`. No ROM-derived outputs are tracked by Git.

Run the native port:

```powershell
.\build\double_dribble_game.exe .\build\double-dribble.assetpack
```

Use Up/Down to choose a title option. Press Enter or Space on **1P** to start the intro; Escape exits. Versus is visible for menu fidelity but is not implemented yet.

Reproduce the reference and native captures:

```powershell
.\tools\fceux\Capture-OriginalTitle.ps1 -FinalFrame 30
.\tools\Capture-NativeTitle.ps1
.\tools\Compare-TitleCaptures.ps1
.\tools\fceux\Capture-Original1PIntro.ps1 -StartFrame 75 -FinalFrame 1500
.\tools\Capture-NativeIntro.ps1 -OriginalFrame 180
.\tools\Compare-IntroCaptures.ps1 -OriginalFrame 180
```
